Unity Files required for reproduction of Brooks task

Built on a PC using C# in Unity version 5.0.1f (free version)

The Brooks file is specific to unity and it contains all of the graphics necessary for the game in the proper dimension and spacing.

The Player 1.prefab file is also specific to unity and should be dragged into the scenes hierarchy. The prefab is default for the right joystick but if the user clicks the "Thumbstick" option under the Player 2 (script) drop down control will be given to the left joy stick.

The controller for the game is a USB xbox 360 controller. Unity is a microsoft friendly software and it will easily recognize the controller upon being plugged into the computer. However, larger commercial joysticks can also be used in Unity it researchers are studying a population with reduced thumb dexterity.
